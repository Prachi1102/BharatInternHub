## Introduction

Predicting house prices is a crucial task in the real estate industry, involving the analysis of various attributes that influence property values. This project employs machine learning techniques to build a model that predicts house prices based on a set of input features. The model's predictions can be valuable for both buyers and sellers, aiding in pricing strategies and negotiation processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). It comprises a diverse range of housing attributes such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. The target variable is the sale price of houses.

## Features

The dataset contains a variety of features that are used as input for the prediction model. Some of the features include:

- Overall quality
- Number of bedrooms
- Total square feet
- Neighborhood
- Year built
- Garage size
- Pool availability

## Methodology

The project follows these general steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identifying potential outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.

4. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for predicting house prices.

5. **Model Training**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the selected models on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

8. **Prediction and Interpretation**: Deploying the trained model to make predictions on new data and interpreting the results.

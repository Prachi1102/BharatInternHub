## Introduction

Predicting the quality of wine is a complex task that involves understanding the relationships between different chemical properties and the sensory characteristics of wines. This project employs machine learning techniques to create a model that predicts wine quality based on a set of input features. The model's predictions can provide valuable insights to winemakers and enthusiasts.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). It contains red and white wine samples, each with various physicochemical attributes. The quality of wines is rated on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating better quality.

## Features

The dataset includes a range of physicochemical features that are used as inputs for the prediction model. Some of the features include:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

## Methodology

The project follows these general steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing feature scaling or normalization.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and identifying potential outliers.

3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for prediction using techniques like correlation analysis.

4. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression).

5. **Model Training**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the selected models on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance by tuning hyperparameters.

8. **Prediction and Interpretation**: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data and interpreting the results.
